# CS-210-Programming-Languages

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a program that runs as a 12 and 24 hour clock. The program allows the user to add hours and minutes and seconds to set the time, and the two clocks should increment in sync. When the user is done with the program, they can make a selection to exit the program.

# What did you do particularly well?
I am good at formatting the code and crafting it to the industry best standards guidelines. Without properly formatted code with appropriate spaces, white space, and comments, the code would be extremely hard to decipher and it would lose readability. I make the code clear and easy for a human reader to understand. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code for my program does not allow the two clocks to stay in sync and increment together. When the user adds hours, it only adds to one of the clocks. I could fix this by adding a piece of code to the other clock that would allow it to increment in sync with the other.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Formatting the menu for the program was difficult for me. I did not know how to to duplicate the asterisk a multiple amount of times so I ended up just typing the asterisk about 26 times to form the border of the menu selections. Afterwards, I found some tutorials on how to solve the problem, so I know that for next time.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project utilized loops and I think that will come into play in many different types of programs that I may write in the future. It is an important skill to know.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable my following best industry standard practices. When the code is formatted well and is easy to read and understand, it allows it to be used and altered by other programmers easily to fit their needs.
